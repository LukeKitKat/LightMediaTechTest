# Light-Media Technical Test
**Candidate:** Luke Nicholas Chalkley

**Position Applying For:** Web Developer

**Version of .NET:** Version 8

**Date Submitted:** 24/02/2025

**Additional Instructions:**
* The application can be run by opening the project Solution within Visual Studio and using the Build and Run button at the top of the page:

* Before running, please ensure the Build and Run button at the top of the page has `https` selected. For best results please also ensure the `Web Browser` setting is set to `Google Chrome`. This is the browser I worked with whilst developing the application and is likely will work the best.
* The database is designed to be code-first. This means there are no necessary T-SQL or generation scripts required as the database itself, it's tables and any seeded data will be automatically generated upon running the program for the first time.
* It is unlikely that you will need to, but if for whatever reason you wish to alter anything in the connection string for the database you can do so within the `appsettings.json` file located within `Client.LightMediaTechTest`

Hi There!

I hope the code provided meets your standards for a developmental structure and code legibility. I apologise that this task took me longer than originally expected. I had to create a code-first database design purely from imagination and so spent a lot of time wrestling with EntityFramework to get things working.

I hosted this code on a private GitHub repository for the sake of my development process so I could have access to source control in case I needed to go back to a previous version, hence the additional GitHub resources and files within the project.

Listed below will be what is utilised within the project to complete the required specifications:

**Front-End:**
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

**Back-End:**
* C# Version 12
* .NET 8
* Dependency Injection
* EntityFramework Core

**Data Storage:**
* SQLServer

**Application Environment:**
* Blazor Server Web Application Framework

If there are any issues with running this application, please don't hesistate to let me know. I have made sure the program does actually run, however, Blazor Web Apps can be a little fiddley to run sometimes.
