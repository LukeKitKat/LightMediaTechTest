Hi There!

I hope the code provided meets your standards for a developmental structure and code legibility. I apologise that this task took me longer than originally expected. I had to create a code-first database design purely from imagination and so spent a lot of time wrestling with EntityFramework to get things working.

If you're wondering why there are GitHub files included in this, I hosted this code on a private GitHub repository for the sake of my development process so I could have access to source control in case I needed to go back to a previous version.

Listed below will be what is utilised within the project to complete the required specifications:

**Front-End:**
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

**Back-End:**
* C# Version 12
* .NET 8
* Dependency Injection
* EntityFramework Core

**Data Storage:**
* SQLServer

**Application Environment:**
* Blazor Server Web Application Framework

If there are any issues with running this application, please don't hesistate to let me know. I have made sure the program does actually run, however, Blazor Web Apps can be a little fiddley to run sometimes.
